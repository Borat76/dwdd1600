    <h1>Basic Rules</h1> 
    <h2 id="theFieAndEqu">The Field and Equipment</h2>
    <p>A baseball field is a diamond-shaped infield surrounded by a grassy outfield. The infield is divided into four bases: home plate, first base, second base, and third base. A pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield.</p>
    <p>Players on the field wear protective gear, including a helmet with a facemask for batters, and a glove for fielders. The batter uses a wooden or metal bat to hit the ball pitched by the pitcher.</p>
    <h2 id="theBasBatAndPit">The Basics of Batting and Pitching</h2>
    <p>The batter stands in the batter's box and tries to hit the ball pitched by the pitcher. The pitcher throws the ball from the pitcher's mound to try and get the batter out. If the batter hits the ball, they try to run to first base. If they make it to first base safely, they are called a runner. The other team tries to get the runner out by throwing the ball to first base before the runner gets there.</p>
       <h2 id="scoRunAndGetOut">Scoring Runs and Getting Outs</h2>
       <p>Runners score a run by circling the bases and touching home plate. They can score on a hit, a walk, an error, or a sacrifice fly. A team gets three outs per inning. An out can be made by a runner being tagged out, being forced out, or being thrown out. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game.</p>
